<h2>Rat with Hat</h2>


<img src="./RWH_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>This project was the first attempt of 2D and 3D animation and modeling for me.<b> 


<img src="./RWH_Characters.png" width=80% height=80%>

For 3D animation, it was decided to use simple models for animation to create a comical effect. Also, I used outline shader in Blender.

<h2>The brew</h2>

<img src="./TB_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>It was the first platformer that I made in my first year at the university. This game was inspired by Japanese mythology which I have been studying for a long time.<b>

<h2>Chertila (The imp)</h2>

<img src="./CH_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>It was a group project in which I was an artist. I did the environment, 29 animations and concept art for the characters.<b> 

<img src="./CH_Characters.png" width=80% height=80%>

Initially, my team and I wanted to make a story about the ordinary life of a little trickster from khrushchevka. However, we decided 
to add Slavic mythology to the narrative, which I tried to display 
in the character design.

This game has a demo on [itch.io](https://fluris.itch.io/chertila)!

<h2>Childhood</h2>

<img src="./CHLD_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>This project was conceived as the first creation of a 3D model of a person by me.<b> 

<img src="./CHLD_Concept.png" width=80% height=80%>

I created 3 concept art for the main character and chose the last one.

<h2>Sun Made of Glass</h2>

<img src="./SUN_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>This story is about a village in which eternal night has come, in which the environment plays an important role. It was created with both 3D and 2D.<b> 

<img src="./SUN_Concept.png" width=80% height=80%>

The characters were supposed to convey a dark atmosphere, so I used sharp lines.

Having created such a style for the characters, I tried to transfer it to the environment using textures drawn in the same style.

<img src="./SUN_Screen4.png" width=80% height=80%>

<h2>Last Lament</h2>

<img src="./LL_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>My thesis, in which concept art conveyed the atmosphere of a mysterious environment and locations convey a sense of painful physicality.<b> 

In the video, I showed the process of creating the final graphics for the location and it also has a game trailer with a story. Screenshots of locations and concept arts are presented below.

<h2>The door</h2>

<img src="./TD_Cover.png" width=30% height=30%>

<b>The character that was made in Blender for ‚ÄúThe Door‚Äù horror game which is currently in development.<b> 
Little is known about this person, so local old men whisper about them.
